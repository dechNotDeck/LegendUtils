You will need 3 external jars for this to compile: Bukkit, Craftbukkit and PermissionsBukkit

Latest recommended Bukkit: http://ci.bukkit.org/job/dev-Bukkit/promotion/latest/Recommended/
Latest recommended Craftbukkit: http://ci.bukkit.org/job/dev-CraftBukkit/promotion/latest/Recommended/
Latest PermissionsBukkit: http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/permbukkit/files/1-permissions-bukkit-v1-2/

Config is written to plugins/LegendUtils/config.yml

Use LegendUtils.config.write to write your own config strings, read them with readString, readBoolean, readDouble, etc.

Take a look in bitlegend.legendutils.Commands.XpCleanup for Permissions example.

If you add new commands, make sure to include them in plugin.yml or they wont work. Also, use spaces instead of tabs. Tabs break yaml.
